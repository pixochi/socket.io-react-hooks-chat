This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



I got this error when I tried to run yarn after installing yarn
![error_fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98889289/224544737-4a4fa987-599b-4958-8599-0dd53a5e0bb3.png)

When I got this error, I immediately searched and looked for the solution,
as far as i understand the package versions were not up to date


I decided to delete yarn and switch to npm

### `npm install -g npm-check-updates`
### `ncu -u`
### `npm update`
### `npm install`

and run 
### `npm start`
